# Assets used in my scene

- The ./background.jpg image was taken at the top of Crook Peak in Somerset at Sunset a couple of weeks ago by me.
- The ./tower.obj file was initially created by my python script ../scripts/tower.py then modified by hand to add extra details using the base model made by the PyMel.
