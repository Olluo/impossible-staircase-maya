# PyMel Scripts

To run the scripts, open the script editor in the bottom right of Maya, then click "File" > "Source Script..." then navigate to the script of choice (either ./tower.py or ./stairs.py) and click "Open". This should then run the script (note: first time running will take slightly longer as Maya is importing the PyMel module).
